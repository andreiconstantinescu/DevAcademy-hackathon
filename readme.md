#DevAcademy Hackathon

##Requirement:

> Build a web page to allow a human user to play agains the computer the game: Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock.

> The page should have a function for the user to choose one of available option and then display a winner or a looser message.

> Each player picks a hand-shape, then all players reveal their choices at the same time. The winner is the one who defeats the others. The rules of rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock are:

    Scissors cut Paper
    Paper covers Rock
    Rock crushes Lizard
    Lizard poisons Spock
    Spock smashes Scissors
    Scissors decapitate Lizard
    Lizard eats Paper
    Paper disproves Spock
    Spock vaporises Rock
    Rock crushes Scissors

> There are fifteen possible pairings of the five gestures. Each gesture beats two of the other gestures and is beaten by the remaining two. In a tie, the process is repeated until a winner is found. The original rules (rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock) remain the same.
